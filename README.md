Assignment \#4


This is the 4th assignment of the coursera data science specialisation
in which I do basic transformation on exercicing data collected from
Samsung smart watch.

## Getting Started

first clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/LonelyDaoist/assignment-4.git
```

After opening the project in RStudio, run the script *run_analysis.R*
This will generate the *grouped means dataframe*, along with other
stuff.

The script will merge the training and testing sets along with their labels, then it'll extract the means and stds of each measurment and finally will generate a dataframe showing the means grouped by subject and activity
