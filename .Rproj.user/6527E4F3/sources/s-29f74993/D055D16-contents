This is the 4th assignment of the coursera data science specialisation in which I do basic transformation on exercicing data collected from Samsung smart watch.

###Getting Started

first clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/LonelyDaoist/assignment-4.git
```

After opening the project in RStudio, run the script *run_analysis.R*
This will generate the *grouped_means dataframe*, along with other stuff.
